            description: 'Farfalle are a type of pasta commonly known as bow-tie pasta or butterfly pasta. The name is derived from the Italian word farfalle (butterflies). A larger variation of farfalle is known as farfalloni, while the miniature version is called farfalline. Farfalle come in several sizes, but they all have a distinctive "bow tie" shape. Usually, the farfalle are formed from a rectangle or oval of pasta, with two of the sides trimmed to a ruffled edge and the center pinched together to make the unusual shape of the pasta. A ridged version of the pasta is known as farfalle rigate. Though usable with most sauces, farfalle are best suited to cream and tomato sauces.',
